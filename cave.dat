1       You are standing at the end of a road before an old building.
1       Around you is a forest. A small stream flows out of the building and
1       down a gully.
2       You have walked up a hill, still in the forest. The road slopes back
2       down the other side of the hill. There is a building in the distance.
2       A path leaves the road to the west.
3       You are inside a building, a wellhouse for a large spring. On one
3       wall there is a tool rack with a sign above it that says:
3       "Please return all tools to the tool rack."
4       You are in a valley in the forest beside a stream tumbling along a
4       rocky bed.
5       You are in open forest, with a deep valley to one side.
6       You are in open forest near both a valley and a road.
7       At your feet all the water of the stream splashes into a 2-inch slit
7       in the rock. Downstream the streambed is bare rock.
8       You are in a 20-foot depression floored with bare dirt. Set into the
8       dirt is a strong steel grate mounted in concrete. A dry streambed
8       leads into the depression.
9       You are in a small chamber beneath a 3x3 steel grate to the surface.
9       A low crawl over cobbles leads inward to the west.
10      You are crawling over cobbles in a low passage. There is a dim light
10      at the east end of the passage.
11      You are on a path through an open forest. There is a shack in the
11      distance.
12      You are in front of an old miner's shack at the end of a path.
13      You are inside the shack.
14      You are in a splendid chamber thirty feet high. There are frozen rivers
14      of orange stone. At your feet is a small pit breathing traces of white
14      mist.
15      You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of sight to
15      the west. There are openings to either side. Nearby, a wide stone
15      staircase leads downward. The hall is filled with wisps of white mist
15      swaying to and fro, almost as if alive. A cold wind blows up the
15      staircase. There is a passage at the top of a dome behind you.
16      >$<
17      >$<
18      This is a low room with a crude note on the wall. The note says,
18      "You won't get it up the steps."
19      You are in the Hall of the Mountain King, with passages off in all
19      directions.
20      You are at the bottom of the pit with a broken neck.
21      You didn't make it.
22      The dome is unclimbable.
23      You are at the west end of the twopit room. There is a large hole in
23      the wall above the pit at this end of the room.
24      You are at the bottom of the eastern pit in the twopit room. There is
24      a small pool of oil in one corner of the pit.
25      You are at the bottom of the western pit in the twopit room. There is
25      a large hole in the wall about 25 feet above you.
26      You clamber up the plant and scurry through the hole at the top.
27      You are on the west side of the fissure in the Hall of Mists.
28      You are in a low N/S passage at a hole in the floor. The hole goes
28      down to an E/W passage.
29      You are in the south side chamber.
30      You are in the west side chamber of the Hall of the Mountain King.
30      A passage continues west and up here.
31      >$<
32      You can't get by the snake.
33      You are in a large room, with a passage to the south, a passage to the
33      west, and a wall of broken rock to the east. There is a large "Y2" on
33      a rock in the room's center.
34      You are in a jumble of rocks, with cracks everywhere.
35      You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of
35      sight. A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below. Traces of
35      white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the right.
35      Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that 
35      someone has been here recently. Directly across the pit from you and
35      25 feet away there is a similar window looking into a lighted room. A
35      shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you.
36      You are in a dirty broken passage. To the east is a crawl. To the west
36      is a large passage. Above you is a hole to another passage.
37      You are on the brink of a small clean climbable pit. A crawl leads
37      west.
38      You are in the bottom of a small pit with a little stream, which enters
38      and exits through tiny slits.
39      You are in a large room full of dusty rocks. There is a big hole in
39      the floor. There are cracks everywhere, and a passage leading east.
40      You have crawled through a very low wide passage parallel to and north
40      of the Hall of Mists.
41      You are at the west end of the Hall of Mists. A low wide crawl continues
41      west and another goes north. To the south is a little passage 6 feet
41      off the floor.
42      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
43      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
44      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
45      You are in an angled passageway with light at the top.
46      You are in a shiny clean room.
47      You are in a narrow twisty passage with many visible paths away.
48      Dead end.
49      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
50      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
51      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
52      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
53      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
54      Dead end.
55      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
56      Dead end.
57      You are on the brink of a thirty foot pit with a massive orange column
57      down one wall. You could climb down here but you could not get back
57      up. The maze continues at this level.
58      Dead end.
59      You have crawled through a very low wide passage parallel to and north
59      of the Hall of Mists.
60      You are at the east end of a very long hall apparently without side
60      chambers. To the east a low wide crawl slants up. To the north a round
60      two foot hole slants down. THere is an exit to the south.
61      You are at the west end of a very long featureless hall. The hall joins
61      up with a narrow north/south passage.
62      You are at the crossover of a high N/S passage and a low E/W one.
63      Dead end.
64      You are at a complex junction. A low hands-and-knees passage from the
64      north joins a higher crawl from the east to make a walking passage
64      going west. THere is also a large room above. The air is damp here.
65      You are in bedquilt, a long east/west passage with holes everywhere.
65      To explore at random select north, south, up, or down.
66      You are in a room whose walls resemble Swiss cheese. Obvious passages
66      go west, east, NE, and NW. Part of the room is occupied by a large
66      bedrock block.
67      You are at the east end of the twopit room. The floor here is littered
67      with thin rock slabs, which make it easty to descend the pits. There is
67      a path here bypassing the pits to connect passages from east and west.
67      There are holes all over, but the only big one is on the wall directly
67      over the west pit where you can't get to it.
68      You are in a large low circular chamber whose floor is an immense slab
68      fallen from the ceiling (slab room). East and west there once were
68      large passages, but they are now filled with boulders. Low small
68      passages go north and south, and the south one quickly bends west
68      around the boulders.
69      You are in a secret N/S canyon above a large room.
70      You are in a secret N/S canyon above a sizable passage.
71      You are in a secret canyon at a junction of three canyons, bearing
71      north, south, and SE. The north one is as tall as the other two
71      combined.
72      You are in a large low room. Crawls lead north, SE, and SW.
73      Dead end crawl.
74      You are in a secret canyon which here runs E/W. It crosses over a very
74      tight canyon 15 feet below. If you go down you may not be able to get
74      back up.
75      You are at a wide place in a very tight N/S canyon.
76      The canyon here becomes too tight to go further south.
77      You are in a tall E/W canyon. A low tight crawl goes 3 feet north and
77      seems to open up.
78      The canyon runs into a mass of boulders -- dead end.
79      The stream flows out through a pair of 1-foot diameter sewer pipes.
79      It would be advisable to use the exit.
80      You are in a maze of twisty little passages. all alike.
81      Dead end.
82      Dead end.
83      You are in a maze of twisty little passages. all alike.
84      You are in a maze of twisty little passages. all alike.
85      Dead end.
86      Dead end.
87      You are in a maze of twisty little passages. all alike.
88      You are in a long, narrow corridor stretching out of sight to the west.
88      At the eastern end is a hole through which you can see a profusion of
88      leaves.
89      There is nothing here to climb. Use "UP" or "OUT" to leave the pit.
90      You have climbed up the plant and out of the pit.
91      You are at the top of a steep incline above a large room. You could
91      climb down here, but you would not be able to climb back up. There is
91      a passage leading back to the north.
92      You are in the giant room. THe ceiling here is too high up for your
92      lamp to show it. Cavernous passages lead east, north, and south. On
92      the west wall is scrawled the inscription, "FEE FIE FOE FOO" sic.
93      The passage here is blocked by a recent cave-in.
94      You are at one end of an immense north/south passage.
95      You are in a magnificent cavern with a rushing stream, which cascades
95      over a sparkling waterfall into a roaring whirlpool which disappears
95      through a hole in the floor. Passages exit to the south and west.
96      You are in the soft room. The walls are covered with heavy curtains,
96      the floor with thick pile carpet. Moss covers the ceiling.
97      This is the Oriental room. Ancient Oriental cave drawings cover the
97      walls. A gently sloping passage leads upward to the north, another
97      passage leads SE, and a hands-and-knees crawl leads west.
98      You are following a wide path around the outer edge of a large cavern.
98      Far below, through a heavy white mist, strange splashing noises can be
98      heard. The mist rises up through a fissure in the ceiling. The path
98      exits to the south and west.
99      You are in an alcove. A small NW path seems to widen after a short
99      distance. An extremely tight tunnel leads east. It looks like a very
99      tight squeeze. An eerie light can be seen at the other end.
100     You're in a small chamber lit by an eerie green light. An extremely
100     narrow tunnel exits to the west. A dark corridor leads NE.
101     You're in the dark room. A corridor leading south is the only exit.
102     You are in an arched hall. A coral passage once continued up and east
102     from here, but is now blocked by debris. The air smells of sea water.
103     You're in a large room carved out of sedimentary rock. The floor and
103     walls are littered with bits of shells embedded in the stone. A shallow
103     passage proceeds downward, and a somewhat steeper one leads up. A low
103     hands-and-knees passage enters from the south.
104     You are in a long sloping corridor with ragged sharp walls.
105     You are in a cul-de-sac about eight feet across.
106     You are in an anteroom leading to a large passage to the east. Small
106     passages go west and up. The remnants of recent digging are evident.
106     A sign in mid-air here says "Cave under construction beyond this point.
106     Proceed at own risk. Witt Construction Company"
107     You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all different.
108     You are at Witt's End. Passages lead off in ALL directions.
109     You are in a north/south canyon about 25 feet across. The floor is
109     covered by white mist seeping in from the north. The walls extend
109     upward for well over 100 feet. Suspended from some unseen point far
109     above you, an enormous two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and
109     midway between the canyon walls. (The mirror is obviously provided
109     for the use of the dwarves, who as you know, are extremely vain.) A
109     small window can be seen in either wall some fifty feet up.
110     You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of
110     sight. A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below. Traces of
110     white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the left.
110     Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that someone
110     has been here recently. Directly across the pit from you and 25 feet
110     away there is a similar window looking into a lighted room. A shadowy
110     figure can be seen there peering back at you.
111     A large stalactite extends from the roof and almost reaches the floor
111     below. You could climb down it, and jump from it to the floor, but
111     having done so you would be unable to reach it to climb back up.
107     You are in a little maze of twisting passages, all different.
113     You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir. An opaque cloud
113     of white mist fills the room and rises rapidly upward. The lake is fed
113     by a stream, which tumbles out of a hole in the wall about 10 feet
113     overhead and splashes noisily into the water somewhere within the mist.
113     The only passage goes back toward the south. There is a little boat at
113     the edge of the reservoir.
114     Dead end.
115     You are at the northeast end of an immense room, even larger than the
115     giant room. It appears to be a repository for the "ADVENTURE" program.
115     Massive torches far overhead bathe the room with smoky yellow light.
115     Scattered about you can be seen a pile of bottles (all of them empty),
115     a nursery of young beanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed of oysters, a
115     bundle of black rods with rusty stars on their ends, and a collection
115     of brass lanterns. Off to one side a great many dwarves are sleeping
115     on the floor, snoring loudly. A sign nearby reads: "Do not disturb the
115     dwarves." An immense mirror is hanging against one wall, and stretches
115     to the other end of the room, where various other sundry objects can
115     be glimpsed dimly in the distance.
116     You are at the southwest end of the repository. To one side is a pit
116     full of fierce green snakes. On the other side is a row of small wicker
116     cages, each of which contains a little sulking bird. In one corner is
116     a bundle of black rods with rusty marks on their ends. A large number
116     of velvet pillows are scattered about on the floor. A vast mirror
116     stretches off to the northeast. At your feet is a large steel grate,
116     next to which is a sign which reads, "Treasure vault. Keys in main
116     office."
117     You are on one side of a large, deep chasm. A heavy white mist rising
117     up from below obscures all view of the far side. A SW path leads away
117     from the chasm into a winding corridor.
118     You are in a long winding corridor sloping out of sight in both
118     directions.
119     You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
120     You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
121     You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
122     You are on the far side of the chasm. A NE path leads away from the
122     chasm on this side.
123     You're in a long east/west corridor. A faint rumbling noise can be
123     heard in the distance. There is some writing on the wall. It appears
123     to be  description of a programming language. The only thing that is
123     legible is: "<command> ::= <verb> <object> | <verb> | <command>,<".
124     The path forks here. The left fork leads northeast. A dull rumbling
124     seems to get louder in that direction. The right fork leads southeast
124     down a gentle slope. The main corridor enters from the west.
125     The walls are quite warm here. From the north can be heard a steady
125     roar, so loud that the entire cave seem to be trembling. Another
125     passage leads south, and a low crawl goes east.
126     You are on the edge of a breath-taking view. Far below you is an active
126     volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging out,
126     cascading back down into the depths. The glowing rock fills the
126     farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving everything
126     an eerie, macabre appearance. The air is filled with flickering sparks
126     of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone. The wall are hot to the touch,
126     and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other sounds. Embedded
126     in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted formations composed
126     of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky light into sinister
126     apparitions upon the walls. To one side is a deep gorge, filled with a
126     bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to have been crafted by
126     the devil himself. An immense river of fire crashes out from the depths
126     of the volcano, burns its way through the gorge, and plummets into a
126     bottomless pit far off to your left. To the right, a gigantic geyser of
126     blistering steam erupts continuously from a barren island in the center
126     of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles ominously. The far right wall is
126     aflame with an incandescence of its own, which lends an additional
126     infernal splendor to the already hellish scene. A dark, foreboding
126     passage exits to the south.
127     You are in a small chamber filled with large boulders. The walls are
127     very warm, causing the air in the room to be almost stifling from the
127     heat. The only exit is a crawl heading west, through which is coming
127     a low rumbling.
128     You are walking along a gently sloping north.south passage lined with
128     oddly shaped limestone formations.
129     You are standing at the entrance to a large, barren room. A sign
129     posted above the entrance reads: "Caution, bear in room."
130     You are inside a barren room. The center of the room is completely
130     empty except for some dust. Marks in the dust lead away toward the far
130     end of the room. The only exit is the way you came in.
131     You are in a maze of twisting little passages, all different.
132     You are in a little maze of twisty passages, all different.
133     You are in a twisting maze of little passages, all different.
134     You are in a twisting little maze of passages, all different.
135     You are in a twisty little maze of passages, all different.
136     You are in a twisty maze of little passages, all different.
137     You are in a little twisty maze of passages, all different.
138     You are in a maze of little twisting passages, all different.
139     You are in a maze of little twisty passages, all different.
140     Dead end.
141     You are in a small room with marble walls, floor, and ceiling. Your
141     foot steps echo.
142     There is a very strong wind blowing through the room from the east
142     passage to the west passage.
143     You're in the chamber of the east wind. There is a sign here that
143     reads: "Danger: strong wind".
144     You're in the west wind passage. The wind is blowing so hard that you
144     cannot continue.
145     The wind is too string -- you get blown away.
146     You are in a room with no name. Passages lead in several directions.
147     You are in a room with mirrors on all the walls.
148     You are in a room with an exit to the south and a smooth slide that
148     exits to the east.
149     You are in a passage with faint pleasant noises.
150     There is a gentle waterfall here. As the water falls through the air,
150     it makes a noise similar to fairies singing and giggling.
151     Spread before you is an organic garden of etiolated plants.
152     You are at the north end of an incredibly wide room.
153     You are in a small room that seems to be a home for a labor of moles.
154     You are in the center of an incredibly wide room.
155     You are at the west end of an incredibly wide room.
156     You are at the east side of an incredibly wide room.
157     You are at the south end of an incredibly wide room.
158     You are on a well traveled path.
159     You are in a hazy passageway.
160     You are in a large room with a beautiful grand piano build into the
160     rock.
161     This is a very strange room. There is a rustling sound off to one side.
162     You are in an empty room.
163     You are in a very creepy room. A sign on the wall says "MAGIC is the
163     word."
164     You are in an obsidian alcove.
165     You are in a large room carved out of obsidian.
166     You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from the surface.
166     A low wide passage with cobbles becomes plugged with mud and debris
166     here, but an awkward canyon leads upward and west.
167     You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir. An opaque cloud
167     of white mist fills the room and rises rapidly upward. The lake is fed
167     by a stream, which tumbles out of a hole in the wall about 10 feet
167     overhead and splashes noisily into the water somewhere within the mist.
167     The only passage goes back toward the west. There is a little boat here.
168     You're in the boat at the north end of the reservoir.
169     You're in the boat in the middle of the reservoir.
170     You're in the boat at the south end of the reservoir.
171     You're in the boat in the middle of the reservoir.
172     You are in an expansive room with a large pair of thrones sitting at
172     one end on a platform. There is a smell of candles in the room.
173     There is a beautiful waterfall here. The sound of the water echoes
173     throughout the cavern. The water rushes down to a pool not far below
173     and seems to continue. An old wooden sign to the right says "Seven
173     Sacred Pools".
174     You don't float with your weight as it is. You drowned.
175     You are in the first of the seven sacred pools. The water is quite
175     pleasing. There is no way back - you must paddle downstream.
176     You are in the second of the seven sacred pools. There are paths to
176     both the east and the west. It looks like there are more pools
176     downstream.
177     You are in the third pool.
178     You are in the fourth pool of the seven sacred pools. There are paths
178     leaving the pool to the east and south. The stream continues to the
178     west.
179     You are in pool five. There is a passage leading north.
180     You are in the sixth pool of the seven sacred pools. The pool is fed
180     from the north, but there is no way to go upstream. Paths lead to this
180     pool from the west and northwest. There appears to be another pool
180     downstream.
181     You are in the seventh pool of the seven sacred pools. There is a
181     tattered sign that reads: "This is the last pool, you are safe now."
182     You are in a musty room. It smells like someone was here just before
182     you.
183     You are in a small room with three exits.
184     You are in an alcove that looks onto the second sacred pool. There is
184     a room on the other side of the pool. There is a crack that you might
184     be able to fit through on the west side of the alcove.
185     This room has a clean hard floor, but is not a dead end.
186     You are in a small room that overlooks the second sacred pool. A piece
186     of a small broken sigh says: "Pleasure - this way". Paths lead to the
186     north, south and west.
187     You are in a maze of many shapeless passages.
188     You are in a maze of many shapeless passages.
189     You are in a maze of many shapeless passages.
190     You are in a maze of many shapeless passages.
191     You are in a maze of many shapeless passages.
192     You are in a maze of many shapeless passages.
193     You are in a maze of many shapeless passages.
194     You are in a maze of many shapeless passages.
195     You are in a maze of many shapeless passages.
196     You are in a maze of many shapeless passages.
197     You are in a maze of many shapeless passages.
198     You are in the Menden Hall of Pleasure. The room has a warm glow.
199     You are in a maze of many shapeless passages.
200     You are in a maze of many shapeless passages.
201     You are in a maze of many shapeless passages.
202     You are in a maze of many shapeless passages.
203     You are in a maze of many shapeless passages.
204     You are in a maze of many shapeless passages.
205     You are in the north end hallway.
206     You have entered into the middle of a long north-south hallway.
207     You are in the south end hallway. You can go up and west from here.
208     There is a lot of writing on the walls. It looks like a long list. It
208     says: "At first Akiba begat Ploph, then Ploph begat Carle; Carle begat
208     Roobi; Roobi begat Borla; Borla begat Borna; Borna begat Borga; Borga
208     begat Akita; Akita begat Nila; Nila begat Dange; Dange begat Epra;
208     Epra begat Akina; Akina begat Egypa; Egypa begat Gorna; Gorna begat
208     Frilo; Frilo begat Norto; Norto begat Gordo; Gordo begat Marta; Marta
208     begat Beglo; Beglo begat Borge; Borge begat Ryplo; Ryplo begat Larse;
208     Larse begat Morge; Morge begat Varna; Varna begat Glorn; ....". In
208     the corner, "Frodo lives" is written in blue crayon. On the wall
208     nearest the exit, "Kazak is the son of Begloph and Raebes" is written
208     in red spray paint.
209     You are in a very damp room. There is no water here, but the air smells
209     of it. There are exits in most directions.
210     You are in a cramped space with exits in most directions.
211     You have come to a "Y" in the path.
212     You are in the south room off of the fourth sacred pool.
213     You are in the west side pool room.
214     You are standing in front of the sixth sacred pool of the seven sacred
214     pools.
215     You are in the east room off of pool number 4. You can exit to the
215     south.
216     You are in a very strange room. Even though your lamp is on, it is as
216     if you had no light at all. I cannot tell which direction is which and
216     I am not sure if there are walls or exits. It is as if all the light is
216     sucked out of the room.
217     You are on a narrow curving east/west passage.
218     You are in the east side pool room.
219     You have entered Lord Kazak's chamber. This room is quite large and has
219     exits to the east and west.
220     You are on a narrow curving east/west passage.
221     You are in a zig-zag east/west hallway.
222     You are in the east end of Grand Hall.
223     You are in the west end of Grand Hall.
224     You are in the east end of Elegant Hall.
225     You are in the west end of Elegant Hall.
226     You are in an extremely narrow north/south hallway.
227     You are on the east bank of a fissure slicing clear across the hall.
228     The crack is far too small for you to follow.
229	You have entered a room that almost seems to pulse with a strange beat.
229     You can overlook pulsating flames that burn from torches far below in
229     the bottom of a pit.
230     You're in the home of the large mole named Murdoc. Passages lead off in
230     all directions, but the only way in is by following Murdoc.
231     You are in a wizard's chamber. The walls are covered with shelves with
231     containers of different substances. The wizard says that his staff will
231     aid you in your adventures, but that mere mortals should be very careful
231     because sorcery is a dangerous thing. He disappears in a puff of silver
231     smoke.
232     You are in the Necromancer's prison. No one has ever escaped from here
232     alive. You have been put in the highest tower and the door shut. Good
232     luck, you'll need it.
233     You are in an extremely small classroom with tiny desks and chairs. At
233     the front of the room is a green blackboard with the homework for the
233     day written on it. It says, "Order is very important when spelling."
233     Spelling homework:  Beleg
233                         Ulmo
233                         Gelbo
234     You are on the east side of the falls. The drops of water reflect back
234     the light in a beautiful rainbow of color.
235     You are on the west side of the falls. The drops of water reflect back
235     the light in a beautiful rainbow of color.
236     You have entered a room with paintings along the north and south sides.
236     The paintings are all of beautiful sunrises.
237     The walls of this room are covered with charcoal drawings of the most
237     exquisite beauty I've ever seen. They are all drawings of sunsets.
238     This room has a very bright hopeful feeling about it. There are strange
238     devices lying on benches lining the walls. Their function can't be
238     determined by me; we'd better leave them alone. A sign on the east wall
238     says: "Science Fair 2025".
239     The room you have just entered has a very stale smell in the air, like
239     it hasn't been disturbed for many, many years. As you look around, you
239     see that this used to be a treasury for an ancient civilization. Most
239     of the treasures have been stolen long ago.
240     You are on an unused path.
241     You are in the spacious Palace of the Elven King. Beautiful old
241     tapestries line the walls and carved pillars support the lofty roof.
241     Enchanting music seems to flow out of nowhere. Many passages lead
241     off to unknown places.
242     You are on a long spiral staircase.
243     You are in a room with a huge oak table with curious carvings around
243     the edges. On the wall to the west is a tapestry depicting a great
243     battle where the elves were able to defeat the Necromancer, but their
243     greatest weapon was broken into four pieces. On the south wall an old
243     piece of parchment is posted.
244     You have entered a great hall with tables and chairs filling the floor.
244     Two rows of pillars march down the length of the hall. The remains of
244     a great feast can be seen.
245     You have entered a very richly decorated chamber, obviously the King's.
245     Great chests and closets contain but a fraction of his robes. One
245     entire wall is covered with shelves loaded with books and rolls of
245     parchment.
246     You are in a sloping east/west tunnel.
247     You are in a long hallway paved with gold and silver. Torches along the
247     walls cast a ruddy glow down the hall. To the west an elf in armor
247     stands blocking the doorway. He asks for the password to enter.
248     You're in a long comforting hallway.
249     You are in a room with many elves sitting on benches. At the south end
249     of the room a very old elf is speaking. He tells of a great ring used
249     long ago, which had great power, but was broken and lost. The ring was
249     made in a secret place near a waterfall but when the enemy learned of
249     its creation place, he caused the water to dry up and a great wind to
249     prevent anyone from approaching.
250     You are in the Elven King's treasury.
251     You are in the kitchen. Great pots and bowls are scattered over the
251     tables. A few elves over in the corner are attempting to clean up.
252     You are in a great room full of barrels and crates and boxes. There
252     are aisles threading around between the stacks.
253     You're in a long sloping east/west tunnel.
254     You're in a long east/west tunnel.
255     You are on the north side of a 50-foot-wide crevasse.
256     You are on the south side of a 50-foot-wide crevasse.
257     You are in the dungeon.
258     You are on a long spiral staircase.
259     You are on a long spiral staircase.
260     You are on a long spiral staircase.
261     You are on a long spiral staircase.
262     You are on a long spiral staircase.
263     You are on a long spiral staircase.
264     You are in a very, VERY strange room. The whole atmosphere seems to be
264     crawling with a powerful force. At the north end of the room a fiercely
264     bright light can be seen.
265     You are at the edge of a deep crack going down into the center of the
265     Earth. A very old, and little used path descends into the crack.
266     You have descended to the very center of the Earth. The heat is very
266     intense here. Some old tools are lying on the ground, seemingly
266     untouched by the heat.
267     You are in a room containing what appears to be the ruins of an ancient
267     temple. On one wall is some writing. It appears to be part of the Greek
267     alphabet.
268     You are in a room with pictures of many geometric shapes painted on the
268     walls. The only way out is the way you came in.
269     You're in the boat at the east side of the reservoir.
270     You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir. An opaque cloud
270     of white mist fills the room and rises rapidly upward. The lake is fed
270     by a stream, which tumbles out of a hole in the wall about 10 feet
270     overhead and splashes noisily into the water somewhere within the mist.
270     The only passage goes back towards the east. There is a little boat here.
271     You are in an extremely narrow passage which slopes downward. The walls
271     are very cold and dripping with condensation.
272     You have entered a room with green walls, a green ceiling, and a green
272     floor. There is a green door in the south wall, and an exit leading NE.
273     You are behind the green door.
274     You are in a room with a sand floor. A warm, dry breeze is blowing
274     through the room from the east exit.

* Section 3: Travel table.
* Each line contains a location number (X), a second location number (Y), and a list
* of motion numbers (see Section 4). Each motion represents a verb which will go to
* Y if currently at X. Y, in turn, is interpreted as follows:
*
* Let M = Y / 4000, N = Y % 4000.
* 	If N <= 1000			Y is the location to go to.
* 	If 1000 < N < 1500		N-1000 is used in a computed condition in
* 					a section of special code.
* 	If 1500 < N < 3000		Message N-1500 from section 6 is printed,
* 					and he stays where he is.
* 	If 3000 < N < 4000		He goes to N-1500, but there is no way back.
*
* Meanwhile, M specifies the conditions on the motion.
*	If M = 0			The motion is unconditional.
*	If 0 < M < 100			The motion is done with M percent probability.
*	If M = 100			Unconditional, but forbidden to dwarves.
*	If 100 < M <= 600		He must be carrying object M-100.
*	If 600 < M <= 1100		Must be carrying or in same room as M-600.
*	If 1100 < M <= 1600		Prop[M-1100] must not be 0.
*	If 1600 < M <= 2100		Prop[M-1600] must not be 1.
*	If 2100 < M <= 2600		Prop[M-2100] must not be 2.
*
* If the condition (if any) is not met, then the next different destination value
* is used (unless it fails to meet its conditions, in which  case the next is found).
* Typically, the next destination will be for one of the same verbs, so that its only
* use is as the alternate destination for those verbs. For instance:
*
*	15	440022	29	31	34	35	23	43
*	15	14	29
*
* This says that, from location 15, any of the verbs 29, 31, etc. will take him to
* location 22 if he is carrying object 10, and otherwise will take him to location 14.
* 
* 	11	4412008	49
*	11	9		50
*
* This says that, from location 11, verb 49 takes him to location 8 unless prop[3] is
* zero, in which case he goes to location 9. Verb 50 takes him to location 9 regardless
* of prop[3].

* Section 4: Vocabulary
* Each line contains a number (N) and a list of eight-letter words.
* M is N/1000. If M is 0, then the word is a motion verb for use in
* traveling (see Section 3). If M is 1, the word is an object. If 
* M is 2, the word is an action verb (such as "carry" or "attack").
* If M is 3, the word is a special case verb (such as "?) and the
* remainder of N/1000 is an index into Section 6 or is a special
* case subset for spells and incantations. If M is 4, the word is
* one of Lord Kazak's relatives.
*
* Objects from 50 to 80 are considered treasures.

* Each line starts with either an object id or a 4-digit object state.
* Lines starting with an object id also contain the object description.
* Lines starting with a multiple of 1000 represent messages for different
* states of the object. For example, the brass lantern is object 2,
* and can have two states: 0000 for when the lantern is off, and 1000 for
* when the lantern is on. Messages ">$<" receive special treatment in the

1       Somewhere nearby is a colossal cave, where others have found fortunes
1       in treasure and gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are
1       never seen again. Magic is said to work in the cave. I will be your
1       eyes and hands. Direct me with commands of 1 or 2 words. I should tell
1       you that I look at the first eight letters of each word, so you can
1       enter either "northeast" or "ne" to distinguish it from "north".
1       Should you get stuck, type "help" for some general hints. For
1       information on how to end your adventure, etc., type "info". Good luck!
2       A little dwarf with a big knife blocks your way.
3       A little dwarf just walked around a corner, saw you, threw a little axe
3       at you which missed, cursed, and ran away.
4       There is a threatening little dwarf in the room with you!
5       One sharp nasty knife is thrown at you.
6       None of them hit you.
7       One of them gets you.
8       A hollow voice says "Prugh".
9       There is no way to go in that direction.
10      I'm unsure how you are facing. Use compass points or nearby objects.
11      I don't know in from out here. Use compass points or name something in
11      the general direction you want to go.
12      I don't know how to apply that word here.
13      I don't understand that.
14      I'm game. Would you care to explain how?
15      Sorry, but I a not allowed to give more detail. I will repeat the long
15      description of your location.
16      It is now pitch dark. If you proceed you will likely fall into a pit.
17      If you prefer, simply type "w" rather than "west".
18      Are you trying to catch the bird?
19      The bird is frightened right now and you cannot catch it no matter what
19      you try. Perhaps you might try later.
20      Are you trying to somehow deal with the snake?
21      You can't kill the snake, or drive it away, or avoid it, or anything
21      like that. There is a way to get by, but you don't have the necesssary
21      resources right now.
22      Do you really want to quite now?
23      You fell into a pit and broke every bone in your body.
24      You are already carrying it.
25      You can't be serious...
26      The bird was unafraid when you entered, but as you approach it becomes
26      disturbed and you cannot catch it.
27      You can catch the bird, but you cannot carry it.
28      There is nothing here with a lock.
29      You aren't carrying it.
30      The little bird attacks the green snake, and in an astounding flurry
30      drives the snake away.
31      You have no keys.
32      It has no lock.
33      I don't know how to lock or unlock such a thing.
34      It was already locked.
35      The grate is now locked.
36      The grate is now unlocked.
37      It was already unlocked.
38      You have no source of light.
39      Your lamp is now on.
40      Your lamp is now off.
41      There is no way to get past the bear to unlock the chain, which is
41      probably just as well.
42      Nothing happens.
43      Where?
44      There is nothing here to attack.
45      The little bird is now dead. Its body disappears.
46      Attacking the snake both doesn't work and is very dangerous.
47      You killed a little dwarf.
48      You attack a little dwarf, but he dodges out of the way.
49      With what? Your bare hands?
50      Good try, but that is an old worn-out magic word.
51      I know of places, actions, and things. Most of my vocabulary describes
51      places and is used to move you there. To move, try words like forest,
51      building, downstream, enter, east, west, north, south, up, or down. I
51      know about a few special objects, like a black rod hidden in the cave.
51      These objects can be manipulated using some of the action words that I
51      know. Usually you will need to give both the object and the action word
51      (in either order), but sometimes I can infer the object from the verb
51      alone. Some objects also imply verbs; in particular, "inventory" implies
51      "take inventory", which causes me to give you a list of what you're
51      carrying. The objects have side effect; for instance, the rod scares
51      the bird. Usually people having trouble moving just need to try a few
51      more words. Usuallyl people trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object
51      are attempting something beyond there (or my) capabilities and should
51      try a completely different approach. To speed the game you can sometimes
51      move long distances with a single word. For example, "building" usually
51      gets you to the building from anywhere above ground except when lost in
51      the forest. Also, note that cave passages turn a lot, and that leaving
51      a room to the north does not guarantee entering the next from the south.
51      Occasionally, the word "all" can be used in some very useful places.
51      And remember, I look at eight characters of every word.
51         Good luck!
52      It misses.
53      It gets you!
54      OK
55      You can't unlock the keys.
56      You have crawled around in some little holes and would up back in the
56      main passage.
57      I don't know where the cave is, but hereabouts no stream can run on the
57      surface for long. I would try the stream.
58      I need more detailed instructions to do that.
59      I can only tell you what you see as you move about and manipulate things.
59      I cannot tell you where remote things are.
60      I don't know that word.
61      What?
62      Are you trying to get into the cave?
63      The grate is very solid and has a hardened steel lock. You cannot enter
63      without a key, and there are no keys nearby. I would recommend looking
63      elsewhere for the keys.
64      The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple, with an
64      occasional grove of pine or spruce. There is quite a bit of under-
64      growth, largely birch and ash saplings plus non-descript bushes of
64      various sorts. This time of year visibility is quite restricted by
64      all the leaves, but travel is quite easy if you detour around the
64      spruce and berry bushes.
65      Welcome to ADVENTURE. Would you like instructions?
66      Digging without a shovel is quite impractical. Even with a shovel
66      progress is unlikely.
67      Blasting requires dynamite.
68      I'm as confused as you are.
69      Mist is a white vapor, usually water, seen from time to time in caverns.
69      It can be found anywhere but is frequently a sign of a deep pit leading
69      down to water.
70      Your feet are now wet.
71      I think I just lost my appetite.
72      Thank you, it was delicious.
73      You have taken a drink from the stream. The water tastes strongly of
73      minerals, but is not unpleasant. It is extremely cold.
74      The bottle of water is now empty.
75      Rubbing the electric lamp is not particularly rewarding. Anyway, nothing
75      exciting happens.
76      Peculiar. Nothing unexpected happens.
77      Your bottle is empty and the ground is wet.
78      You can't pour that.
79      Watch it!!
80      Which way?
81      Oh dear, you seem to have gotten yourself killed. I might be able to
81      help you out, but I've never really done this before. Do you want me to
81      try to reincarnate you?
82      All right. But don't blame me if something goes wr......
82                         --- POOF ---
82      You are engulfed in a cloud of orange smoke. Coughing and gasping, you
82      emerge from the smoke and find....
83      You clumsy oaf, you've done it again! I don't know how long I can keep
83      this up. Do you want me to try reincarnating you again>
84      Okay, now where did I put my orange smoke? ....>POOF<
84      Everything disappears in a dense cloud of orange smoke.
85      Now you've really done it. I'm all out of smoke. You don't expect me
85      to do a decent reincarnation without any smoke at all, do you?
86      Okay, I've found some black smoke. I can't promise anything. You know,
86      you could turn into a dwarf with this stuff. ...>FOOP<
87      Now you've really done it. I'm all out of smoke. You don't expect me
87      to do a decent reincarnation without any smoke at all, do you?
88      Okay, if you're so smart, do it yourself. I'm leaving.
91      Sorry, but I no longer seem to remember how it was you got here.
92      You can't carry anything more. You'll have to drop something first.
93      You can't go through a locked steel grate.
94      I believe what you want is right here with you.
95      You don't fit through a two-inch slit, butthead.
96      I respectfully suggest you go across the bridge instead of jumping.
97      There is no way across the fissure.
98      You're not carrying anything.
99      You are currently holding the following:
100     It's not hungry (it's merely pining for the fjords). Besides, you have
100     no bird seed.
101     The snake has now devoured your bird.
102     There's nothing here it wants to eat (except perhaps you).
103     You fool, dwarves eat only coal. Now you've made him REALLY mad.
104     You have nothing in which to carry it.
105     Your bottle is already full.
106     There is nothing here with which to fill the bottle.
107     Your bottle is now full of water.
108     Your bottle is now full of oil.
109     You can't fill that.
110     Don't be ridiculous!
111     The door is extremely rusty and refuses to open.
112     The plant indignantly shakes the oil off its leaves and asks,"Water?"
113     The hinges are quite thoroughly rusted now and won't budge.
114     The oil has feed up the hinges so that the door will now move, although
114     it requires some effort.
115     The plant has exceptionally deep roots and cannot be pulled free.
116     The dwarves' knives vanish as they strike the walls of the cave.
117     Something you're carrying won't fit through the tunnel with you. You'd
117     best take inventory and drop something.
118     You can't fit this five-foot clam through that little passage.
119     You can't fit this five-foot oyster through that little passage.
120     I advise you to put down the clam before opening it.  >STRAIN<
121     I advise you to put down the oyster before opening it.  >GROAN<
122     You don't have anything strong enough to open the clam.
123     You don't have anything strong enough to open the oyster.
124     A glistening pearl falls out of the clam and rolls away. Goodness, this
124     must really be an oyster. (I never was very good at identifying
124     bivalves.) Whatever it is, it has now snapped shut again.
125     The oyster creaks open, revealing nothing but oyster inside.
125     It promptly snaps shut again.
126     You have crawled around in some little holes and found your way blocked
126     by a recent cave-in. You are now back in the main passage.
127     There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.
128     Out from the shadows behind you pounces a bearded pirate. "Har, har,"
128	he shortles, "I'll just take all this booty and hide it away with me
128     chest deep in the maze." He snatches your treasure and vanishes into
128     the gloom.
129     A sepulchral voice reverberating through the cave says "Cave closing
129     soon. All adventurers exit immediately through the main office."
130     A mysterious recorded voice groans into life and announces:
130     "This exit is closed. Please leave via the main office."
131     It looks as though you're dead. Well, seeing as how it's so close to
131     closing time anyway, I think we'll just call it a day.
132     The sepulchral voice entones, "The cave is now closed." As the echoes
132     fade, there is a blinding flash of light (and a small puff of orange
132     smoke). . . .  As our eyes refocus, you look around and find...
133     There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
133     wall, burying the snakes in the rubble. You march through the hole
133     and find yourself in the main office, where a cheering band of friendly
133     elves carry the conquering adventurer off into the sunset.
134     There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
134     wall, burying the snakes in the rubble. A river of molten lava pours
134     in through the hole, vaporizing everything in its path, including you.
135     There is a loud explosion, and you are suddenly splashed across the
135     walls of the room.
136     The resulting ruckus has awakened the dwarves. There are now several
136     threatening little dwarves in the room with you. Most of them throw
136     knives at you. All of them get you.
137     Oh, leave the poor unhappy bird alone.
138     I daresay whatever you want is around here somewhere.
139     I don't know the word "stop". Use "quit" if you want to give up.
140     You can't get there from here.
141     You are being followed by a very large tame bear.
142     I look at the first eight (8) characters of every word.
142     If you want to end your adventure early, say "quit". To suspend your
142     adventure such that you can sontinue later, say "suspend" (or "pause"
142     or "save"). To see what hours the cave is normally open, say "hours".
142     To see how well you're doing, say "score" or "status". To get full
142     credit for a treasure, you must leave it safely in the building,
142     although you do get partial credit for simply locating it. You lose
142     points for getting killed, or for quitting, though the former costs
142     you more. You can be injured, which will reduce the number of things
142     you can carry. There are also points based on how much (if any) of the
142     cave you've managed to explore. In particular, there is a large bonus
142     just for getting in (to distinguish the beginners from the rest of the
142     pack), and there are other ways to determine whether you've been through
142     some of the more harrowing sections. If you think you've found all the
142     treasures, just keep exploring for a while. If nothing interesting
142     happens, you haven't found them all yet. If something interesting DOES
142     happen, it means you're getting a bonus and have an opportunity to
142     garner many more points in the master's section. I may occasionally
142     offer hints if you seem to be having trouble. If I do, I'll warn you in
142     advance how much it will affect your score to accept the hints. Finally,
142     to save time, you may specify "brief", which tells me never to repeat
142     the full description of a place unless you explicitly ask me to. If you
142     type "credit" or "history" or "authors", I will tell you about the 
142     source and history of this game.
143     Would you like to quit now?
144     There is nothing here with which to fill the vase.
145     The sudden change in temperature has delicately shattered the vase.
146     It is beyond your power to do that.
147     I don't know how.
148     It is too far up for you to reach.
149     You killed a little dwarf. The body vanishes in a cloud of greasy black
149     smoke.
150     The shell is very strong and is impervious to attack.
151     What's the matter? Can't you read? Now you'd best start over.
152     The axe bounces harmlessly off the dragon's thick scales.
153     The dragon looks rather nasty. You'd best not try to get by.
154     The little bird attacks the blue dragon, and in an astounding flurry
154     gets burnt to a cinder. The ashes blow away.
155     On what?
156     Okay, from now on, I'll only describe a place in full the first time you
156     come to it. To get the full description, say "look".
157     Trolls are close relatives with the rocks and have skin as tough as that
157     of a rhinoceros. The troll fends off your blows effortlessly.
158     The troll deftly dodges the axe, examines it carefully, and tosses it
158     back, declaring "Good workmanship, but it's not valuable enough."
159     The troll catches your treasure and scurries away out of sight.
160     The troll refuses to let you cross.
161     There is no longer any way to cross the chasm.
162     Just as you reach the other side, the bridge buckles beneath the weight
162     of the bear, which was still following you around. You scramble
162     desperately for support, but as the bridge collapses you stumble back
162     and all into the chasm.
163     The bear lumbers toward the troll, who lets out a startled shriek and
163     scurries away. The bear soon gives up the pursuit and wanders back.
164     The axe misses and land near the bear where you can't get to it.
165     With what? Your bare hands" Against HIS bear hands?
166     The bear is confused; he only wants to be your friend.
167     For crying out loud, the poor thing is already dead.
168     The bear eagerly wolfs down your food, after which he seems to calm
168     down considerably and even becomes rather friendly.
169     The bear is still chained to the wall.
170     The chain is still locked.
171     The chain is now unlocked.
172     The chain is now locked.
173     There is nothing here to which the chain can be locked.
174     There is nothing here to eat.
175     Do you want the hint?
176     Do you need help getting out of the maze?
177     You can make the passages look less alike by dropping things.
178     Are you trying to explore beyond the plover room?
179     There is a way to explore that region without having to worry about
179     falling into a pit. None of the objects available is immediately 
179     useful in discovering the secret.
180     Do you need help getting out of here?
181     Don't go west.
182     Gluttony is not one of the troll's vices. Avarice, however, is.
183     Your lamp is getting dim. You'd best start wrapping this up, unless
183     you can find some fresh batteries. I seem to recall there's a vending
183     machine in the maze. Bring some coins with you.
184     Your lamp has run out of power.
185     There's not much point in wandering around out here, and you can't
185     explore the cave without a lamp. So let's just call it a day.
186     There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you. As you
186     turn toward them, the beam of your lamp falls across a bearded pirate.
186     He is carrying a large chest. "Shiver me timbers!" he cries, "I've been
186     spotted. I'd best hie meself off to the maze to hide me chest." With
186     that, he vanishes into the gloom.
187     You lamp is getting dim. You'd best go back for those batteries.
188     You lamp is getting dim. I'm taking the liberty of replacing the
188     batteries.
189     You lamp is getting dim, and you're out of spare batteries. You'd best
189     start wrapping this up.
190     I'm afraid the magazine is written in Dwarvish.
191     "This is not the maze where the pirate leaves his treasure chest."
192     Hmm, this looks like a clue, which means it'll cost you 10 points to
192     read it. Should I go ahead and read it anyway?
193     It says, "there is something strange about this place, such that one of
193     the words I've always known now has a new effect."
194     It says the same thing it did before.
195     I'm afraid I don't understand.
196     "Congratulations on bringing light into the dark-room."
197     You strike the mirror with a resounding blow, whereupon it shatters int
197     a myriad of tiny fragments.
198     You have taken the vase and hurled it delicately to the ground.
199     You prod the nearest dwarf, who wakes up grumpily, takes one look at
199     you, curses, and grabs for his axe.
200     Is this acceptable?
201     There's no point in suspending a demonstration game.
202     I can see light through the slits but the passage is blocked.
203     The wind is so strong you have difficulty moving.
204     Ouch! You ran into one of the mirrored walls.
205     Now you've done it! There is a hole in the floor.
206     Huh?
207     Woopsie!
208     Very interesting...
209     This is incredible!!!
210     What about a boat?
211     You will probably drown if you go down there.
212     There is nothing here you can carry.
213     I can't read anything. The light is too bad.
214     Your food is accepted, thankfully. As a token of their appreciation,
214     they put out a carved animal figure.
215     They refuse your offer, but say thanks.
216     Again you have pleased them, and they put a rare conch shell out for
216     you.
217     It was alseep. (Ermine don't usually eat while they are sleeping.) You
217     upset it and it bit you. I have a band-aid, but you won't be able to
217     carry as many things as before.
218     Come on, now. There is only so much room in a cage.
219     You can't carry the ermine in your bare hands.
220     AARG.. In an attempt to wake the ermine you upset it and it bit you.
220     I have a band-aid, but you won't be able to carry as many things as
220     before.
221     You have messed yourself up so badly that you can't even carry the lamp.
221     Why don't we just call it a day. Come back some other time.
222     Great move! He has done damage to your leg. I have a bandage, but you
222     won't be able to carry as much as before.
223     That is not even the name of one of my relatives!  STUDY!!!
223                      K A Z A P
224     Wrong! Back to the room to study!
224     ------ K A Z A K
225     You have pleased Lord Kazak. He bows to you, jumps up in the air, spins
225     around three times, shouts "K-A-A-Z-A-A-K", and vanishes in a cloud of
225     black and orange smoke.
226     There is an incredibly ugly monster following you. He (at least I think
226     it's a he) has large nostrils and skin that looks like plates of slimy
226     green moss.
227     A large winged fire-breathing dragon has flown into the room with you.
228     Good job! You have killed the flying dragon. The carcass smolders a
228     moment, then with a great blast disappears in a cloud of smoke.
229     Good job! You have killed the slimy nostril monster. He (she?) has
229     turned into a puddle on the floor and has slowly evaporated.
230     The troll catches the spices, and opens the container. He sneezes
230     violently, and uncontrollably, falls to the ground and seems to become
230     part of it. He has died from an allergic reaction.
231     You have managed to would the dragon, but in the tustle you have also
231     been wounded and are now unable to carry as many things as before.
232     The maze may take on some shape if you go south.
233     You have entered Lord Kazak's chamber. The room is quite large. Standing
233     before you is a tall gromlet in an outrageous costume, obviously Lord
233     Kazak himself (for a lord, he sure has a funny nose).
234     Unbelievable! The monster has inhaled the axe.
235     In a wild rage the nostril monster attacks, and you can't get out of the
235     way.
236     In a wild rage the nostril monster attacks. He just misses.
237     The dragon comes swooping down breathing fire at you. It is quite warm.
238     The dragon comes swooping down breathing fire at you. He is coming
238     directly towards you.
239     He came so close that you have been badly burned. You won't be able to
239     carry as much as before.
240     As it flies by it sounds like it is saying the word "Murdoc".
241     There is a thin mist here. It seems to have a character to it, something
241     strange, yet comfortable, almost friendly.
242     A round friendly person dressed in a monk's robe has entered the room.
242     He introduces himself as Friar Truck, and proceeds to put a horrible-
242     smelling salve on your wounds. It is quite soothing and heals all of
242     your injuries. You have completely recovered.
243     A round friendly person dressed in a monk's robe has entered the room.
243     He introduces himself as Friar Truck, and offers you an herb.
244     The herb tastes awful, but what a feeling! You are now significantly
244     stronger than before and able to carry more than you previously could.
245     There is an immense hairy creature in the room with you. It's a giant
245     mole! It seems to be wandering about aimlessly, eyeing you with some
245     hesitation.
246     The mole is frightened and runs off.
247     Responding to its true name, the mole asks you to follow him and he will
247     lead you to a new place.
248     The mole has burrowed through the wall, and as you follow him the wall
248     behind you caves in. There is no way back.
249     You tripped as you moved and dropped the wad of paper. But before it hit
249     the ground, it turned into a bird and flew into the forest.
250     No reply.
251     Ok,  ... * S M A C K *   Now what?
252     There is a wicked necromancer in the room with you named Melkor. He is
252     very dangerous and I would advise you to get away quickly, unless you
252     know the magic spell to rid the cave of his presence.
253     You didn't escape quickly enough. You have been sent to his fortress
253     for "safe keeping".
254     The staff snickers in your hand and says "That was a good try, but even
254     an apprentice can do better than that."
255     Okay, it's gone.
256     The staff has beaten you severely. You can't carry as much as before.
257     The staff turns into an eagle and flies away.
258     The staff quivers violently in your hand, as if confused by your command.
259     Congratulations! You've managed to escape from the Necromancer's tower.
260     You are already on the ground.
261     The staff has turned into a cobra and killed you.
262     The staff becomes slightly warm and begins to light up.
263     The staff suddenly becomes very cold and dark.
264     Okay, if you don't want to carry them any more.
265     There is a flash of green light and you look around to find...
266     There is a puff of greenish smoke and you find that...
267     The room seems to spin violently in circles. As your eyes focus...
268     The staff begins to chuckle, and laugh, and snicker, and titter, and
268     giggle, and ...
269     The staff stops laughing, finally.
270     They are back where they usually are.
271     The staff wriggles free from your grip and slips away.
272     The staff suddenly screams, "He's back in the cave, and he's looking
272     for you!"
273     The staff suddenly screams, "He's back in the cave!"
274     A long slow sigh is heard and the staff shrinks in your hand.
275     The headwaters are being stopped.
276     The headwaters are being released.
277     A blood-curdling scream echoes through the cave, yet it somehow feels
277     much safer and cleaner.
278     They have been moved to a safe place.
279     They are safe now.
280     The staff shakes violently and says, "I hope you know what you are
280     doing. I can't bear to watch."
281     As you plummet towards the rocky ground below, the Necromancer's horrid
281     laughter is heard echoing off the prison walls, and you find yourself...
282     Do you need some help to escape?
283     Given the right support you can do anything, and remember that order
283     must be maintained in the cave.
284     There is no way to cross the river.
285     Do you need some help crossing the river?
286     This way is blocked by something you aren't carrying.
287     Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ho, ho, snicker, snicker, giggle, giggle, titter,
287     titter, te he he he he he he, chuckle, chuckle, chortle, chortle, ...
288     The staff beats you and then races around the room.
289     You have passed the qualifications necessary to become an honorary
289     member of the elven community. You are taken to the ELven King, who
289     names you an elf friend and informs you that your adventure is not yet
289     over. There is one more thing you must do, but it will tax your
289     abilities to the limit. Suddenly, the host of elves disappears.
290     You can't get to the other side of the crevasse.
291     There is nothing here to assemble.
292     There is not enough here to assemble.
293     I can't seem to get all the pieces to fit. When they come in contact
293     with one another their shape is distorted by some power. Maybe some
293     heat would solve the problem.
294     The ring begins to glow. First, dimly. Then, brightly. Then, even 
294     more brightly. It becomes so bright that you cannot see. It suddenly
294     stops glowing. As you slowly regain your sight, you see that you are
294     once again in the Main Office. The president of the Witt Construction
294     company is there to personally shake your hand and congratulate you.
295     As it comes together, it becomes very hot and you have to drop it to
295     keep from being burned.
296     It was asleep. You upset it and it bit you. I have a band-aid, but you
296     won't be able to carry as many things as before.
297     You have taken the chalice and hurled it viciously to the ground.
298     Are you trying to determine what is under the floor?
299     The object you need to do that is not here with you.
300     The door is already open.
301     The door is already closed.
302     The door is not open.
303     Credits for this game:
303           This program was originally developed by Willie Crowther,
303           and added to by Don Woods.
303           The next version was modified by Denny Koch.
303           It was expanded upon by Don Fry.
303           And further revised by Keith Moe.
303           The current version was completely rewritten in Java
303           by Mark White.
304     Alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, ...
305     The ground is too hard and the shovel does nothing.
306     Dig what?
307     I can dig it but I can't dig that!
308     The crowbar has landed on your foot and injured you. You won't be able
308     to carry as much stuff as before.
309     The vending machine is already broken. You want to completely destroy
309     it or something?
310     The vending machine breaks open, causing some batteries to fall to the
310     ground, but the batteries have been heavily damaged.
311     The vending machine breaks open, but nothing falls out.
312     You know, it's really kind of silly to wander around outside with your
312     lamp on.
313     You have nothing with which to attack the dragon. It has injured you and
313     you can't carry as much now.
314     In case you didn't know, I now look at eight(8) characters of each word,
314     instead of five(5), as I used to.
315     You're not making any sense.
316     The game is now being logged.
317     The game is no longer being logged.
318     Please answer the question.
319     You just went off my scale.
320     To achieve the next higher rating would be a neat trick.
321     Congratulations!
322     Lord Kazak asks:
323     Do you really want to suspend this game?
324     Open from 6:00pm to 9:00am Monday - Thursday, and from 6:00pm Friday to
324     9:00am Monday.
325     The suspend file does not match the current level of this game. Do you
325     wish to play from the beginning?
326     A suspended game is being resumed.
327     The game has been saved in the SUSPEND file.
328     In the dark, you have fallen into a pit. Although you have climbed out,
328     you have been injured and cannot carry as many things as before.
329     Do you really wish to resume the suspended game?
330     The SUSPEND file is undefined. The suspend/resume functions are being
330     disabled.
331     The write to the SUSPEND file failed. The suspend/resume functions are disabled.

* Hints index
* Each line contains a hint number (corresponding to a cond bit, see
* Section 9), the number of turns he must be at the right location(s)
* before triggering the hint, the message number (Section 6) of the
* question to ask, and the message number of the hint. These values
* are stashed in the hints array. Hintsize is set to the maximum hint
* number. Numbers 1-7 are unusable since cond bits are otherwise
* assigned, so 2 is used to remember if he's read the clue in the
* repository, and 3 is used to remember whether he asked for instructions
* (gets more turns, but loses points).
